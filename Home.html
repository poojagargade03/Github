<div class="article_title">House</div>
<div class="article_description">The size of an apartment or house can be described in square feet or meters. In the United States, this includes the area of "living space", excluding the garage and other non-living spaces. The "square meters" figure of a house in Europe may report the total area of the walls enclosing the home, thus including any attached garage and non-living spaces, which makes it important to inquire what kind of surface area definition has been used.</div>

<div class="article_description">Real property is not the same thing and should not to be confused with personal property. Personal property includes intangible assets like investments, along with tangible assets such as furniture and fixtures like a dishwasher. Also, even renters may claim parts of a home as personal property, provided you bought and installed the property with the lessor's permission.</div>

<div class="article_description">Residential real estate includes undeveloped land, houses, condominiums, and townhouses. The structures may be single-family or multi-family dwellings and may be owner-occupied or rental properties.
Commercial real estate includes nonresidential structures such as office buildings, warehouses, and retail buildings. </div>

<div class="article_description">Apartment buildings are multi-story buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an apartment building, apartment complex, flat complex, block of flats, tower block, high-rise or, occasionally, mansion block (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent.  </div>

<div class="right_side">Commercial real estate is used for commerce and includes anything from strip malls and free-standing restaurants to office buildings and skyscrapers. It is often distinguished from industrial real estate, which is practical space used in the manufacturing of products.

Buying or leasing real estate for commercial purposes is very different from buying a home or even buying residential real estate. Commercial leases are generally longer than residential leases. Commercial real estate returns are based on their profitability per square foot, unlike structures intended to be private residences.</div>
